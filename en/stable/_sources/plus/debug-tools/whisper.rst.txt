Whisper
=======

Whisper is a RISCV instruction set simulator (ISS) developed for the verification of the Swerv micro-controller. It allows the user to run RISCV code without RISCV hardware. It has an interactive mode where the user can single step the target RISCV code and inspect/modify the RISCV registers or the simulated system memory. It can also run in lock step with a Verilog simulator serving as a "golden model" against which an implementation is checked after each instruction of a test program.
Official reference can be found `here  <https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/swerv-ISS/?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=docs>`__.
