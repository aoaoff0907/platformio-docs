AppVeyor
========

`AppVeyor <http://www.appveyor.com/about>`_ is an open-source hosted,
distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects
hosted at `GitHub <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>`_ on Windows family
systems.

AppVeyor is configured by adding a file named ``appveyor.yml``, which is a
`YAML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format text file, to the root
directory of the GitHub repository.

AppVeyor automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a
repository that is using AppVeyor, and each time this happens, it will
try to build the project using :ref:`cmd_ci` command. This includes commits to
all branches, not just to the master branch. AppVeyor will also build and run
pull requests. When that process has completed, it will notify a developer in
the way it has been configured to do so â€” for example, by sending an email
containing the build results (showing success or failure), or by posting a
message on an IRC channel. It can be configured to build project on a range of
different :ref:`platforms`.

Integration
-----------

Put ``appveyor.yml`` to the root directory of the GitHub repository. The contents of
this file depends on the project you want to add. There are two possible ways of running
PlatformIO in CI services:

Using :ref:`cmd_run` command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variant is default choice for native PlatformIO projects:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build: off
    environment:

    install:
        - cmd: git submodule update --init --recursive
        - cmd: SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts
        - cmd: pip install -U platformio

    test_script:
        - cmd: pio run -e <ID_1> -e <ID_2> -e <ID_N>


Using :ref:`cmd_ci` command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variant is more convenient when project is written as a library (when there are
examples or testing code) as it has additional options for specifying extra libraries
and boards from command line interface:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build: off
    environment:

      matrix:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\file.c"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\file.ino"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "path\\to\\source\\directory"

    install:
        - cmd: git submodule update --init --recursive
        - cmd: SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts
        - cmd: pip install -U platformio

    test_script:
        - cmd: pio ci --board=<ID_1> --board=<ID_2> --board=<ID_N>



Examples
--------

1. Integration for `USB_Host_Shield_2.0 <https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0>`_
   project. The ``appveyor.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build: off
    environment:

      matrix:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "examples\\Bluetooth\\PS3SPP\\PS3SPP.ino"
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC: "examples\\pl2303\\pl2303_gps\\pl2303_gps.ino"

    install:
        - cmd: git submodule update --init --recursive
        - cmd: SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27\Scripts
        - cmd: pip install -U platformio
        - cmd: git clone https://github.com/xxxajk/spi4teensy3.git C:\spi4teensy

    test_script:
        - cmd: pio ci --lib="." --lib="C:\\spi4teensy" --board=uno --board=teensy31 --board=due
