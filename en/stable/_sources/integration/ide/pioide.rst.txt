PlatformIO IDE
==============

.. include:: pioide_features.rst

-------------

We provide official packages (plugins, extensions) for the most popular IDEs
and text editors.

.. note::
    In our experience, :ref:`ide_vscode` offers better system performance, and users
    have found it easier to get started

PlatformIO for VSCode
---------------------

**Visual Studio Code** is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which
runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes
with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP,
Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).
