Migrating from 4.x to 5.0
=========================

Guidance on how to upgrade from :ref:`piocore` v4.x to v5.x with emphasis on
major changes, what is new, and what has been removed.

**PlatformIO Core 5.0 is fully backward compatible with PlatformIO 4.0 projects.**

Please read :ref:`PlatformIO 5.0 Release Notes <release_notes_5>` before.

.. contents:: Contents
  :local:

Migration Steps
---------------

1. Ensure that you do not use a short version of the Github declaration in :ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`.
   Please use ``https://github.com/username/repo.git`` instead of ``username/repo``.
2. We recommend updating your project dependency declarations in :ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`
   using a new owner-based syntax. See  the :ref:`core_migration_libmanager` section for details.

What is new
-----------

In this section, we are going to highlight the most important changes and
features introduced in :ref:`piocore` 5.0. Please visit
:ref:`PlatformIO 5.0 Release Notes <release_notes_5>` for more detailed information.

PlatformIO Trusted Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO Core 5.0 has been switched to the official **PlatformIO Trusted Registry**:

- Enterprise-grade package storage with high availability (multi replicas)
- Secure, fast, and reliable global content delivery network (CDN)
- Universal support for all packages:

  * Libraries
  * Development platforms
  * Toolchains

- Built-in fine-grained access control (role-based, :ref:`teams <cmd_team>`, :ref:`organizations <cmd_org>`).

The new Web front-end and upgraded :ref:`piohome` are coming soon.

Collaborative Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO Core 5.0 is fully unlocked for developers and teams. They can now share their
packages (libraries, :ref:`platforms`, toolchains) with team members or collaborate
on open source projects. There are new CLI commands that help you to manage
organizations, teams, team memberships, and resource access:

* :ref:`cmd_package` – manage packages in the registry
* :ref:`cmd_org` - manage organizations
* :ref:`cmd_team` - manage teams and team memberships
* :ref:`cmd_access` – manage package access for users, teams, and maintainers.

Package Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package management infrastructure has been rewritten from scratch.
It is based now on the new **PlatformIO Trusted Registry**
that supports a strict dependency declaration using the package owner. This improvement
resolves the issues when package maintainers publish packages under the same name.

PlatformIO Core 5.0 does not handle packages from unofficial repositories declared via
``packageRepositories`` in ``platform.json``. There were a lot of security issues and
reports when PlatformIO Core 4.0 hangs when you manage external dependencies.

PlatformIO Core 5.0 uses THE ONLY official **PlatformIO Trusted Registry** that
supports not only the libraries but also :ref:`platforms` and toolchains.

Package maintainers can publish their libraries, development platforms, and toolchains
to the registry using :ref:`cmd_package` CLI.

.. _core_migration_libmanager:

Library Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The biggest improvement for :ref:`librarymanager` is the owner-based dependency declaration.
You can finally forget about conflicts with library names in the registry. Use the new
syntax ``ownername/pkgname`` to declare an owner-based dependency in :ref:`projectconf`
via :ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = ...
  framework = ...
  board = ...
  lib_deps =
    bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^6.16.1
    knolleary/PubSubClient @ ^2.8

You can find an owner name of a library in the registry using
:ref:`piohome` > Libraries > Some Library > Installation tab.

Build System
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCons 4.0
'''''''''

PlatformIO Core 5.0 build engine has been upgraded to the latest `SCons 4.0 - a next-generation software construction tool <https://scons.org/>`__:

* :ref:`Configuration files are Python scripts <projectconf_advanced_scripting>` – use the power of a real programming language to solve build problems
* Built-in reliable and automatic dependency analysis
* Improved support for parallel builds
* Ability to :ref:`share built files in a cache <projectconf_pio_cache_dir>` to speed up multiple builds.

Custom Targets
''''''''''''''

PlatformIO Core 5.0 gives more freedom to developers and :ref:`platforms` maintainers.
They can now declare the :ref:`projectconf_advanced_scripting_custom_targets`:

* Pre/Post processing based on dependent sources (another target, source file, etc.)
* Command launcher with own arguments
* Launch command with custom options declared in :ref:`projectconf`
* Python callback as a target (use the power of Python interpreter and PlatformIO Build API)
* List available project targets (including dev-platform specific and custom targets) with a new :option:`platformio run --list-targets` command

See **Build System** section in :ref:`release_notes_5` release notes
for more details.

What is changed or removed
--------------------------

packageRepositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO Core 5.0 does not support unofficial package repositories declared through
``packageRepositories`` in ``platform.json`` that was introduced in PlatformIO 3.0.

Please publish your development platforms and toolchains to the **PlatformIO Trusted
Registry** using :ref:`cmd_package` CLI.
