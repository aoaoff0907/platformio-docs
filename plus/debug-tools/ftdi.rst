Configuration
-------------

You can configure debugging tool using :ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in
:ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = ftdi

If you would like to use this tool for firmware uploading, please change
upload protocol:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = ftdi
    upload_protocol = ftdi

More options:

* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_debug`
* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_upload`
