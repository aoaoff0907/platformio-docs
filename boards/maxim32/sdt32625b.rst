Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_maxim32`: Maxim's microcontrollers provide low-power, efficient, and secure solutions for challenging embedded applications. Maxim's processors embed cutting-edge technologies to secure data and intellectual property, proven analog circuitry for real-world applications, and battery-conserving low power operation.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - MAX32625ITK
  * - **Frequency**
    - 96MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 512KB
  * - **RAM**
    - 160KB
  * - **Vendor**

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``sdt32625b`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt32625b]
  platform = maxim32
  board = sdt32625b

You can override default SDT32625B settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `sdt32625b.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-maxim32/blob/master/boards/sdt32625b.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt32625b]
  platform = maxim32
  board = sdt32625b

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = max32625itk

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 96000000L

Debugging
---------
:ref:`piodebug` currently does not support SDT32625B board.
