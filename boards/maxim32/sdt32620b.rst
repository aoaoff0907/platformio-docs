  * - **Frequency**
    - 96MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 2MB
  * - **RAM**

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``sdt32620b`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt32620b]
  platform = maxim32
  board = sdt32620b

You can override default SDT32620B settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `sdt32620b.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-maxim32/blob/master/boards/sdt32620b.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt32620b]
  platform = maxim32
  board = sdt32620b

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = max32620iwg

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 96000000L

Debugging
---------
:ref:`piodebug` currently does not support SDT32620B board.
