Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_nordicnrf51`: The Nordic nRF51 Series is a family of highly flexible, multi-protocol, system-on-chip (SoC) devices for ultra-low power wireless applications. nRF51 Series devices support a range of protocol stacks including Bluetooth Smart (previously called Bluetooth low energy), ANT and proprietary 2.4GHz protocols such as Gazell.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - NRF51822
  * - **Frequency**
    - 32MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 256KB
  * - **RAM**

    - `Waveshare <http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/BLE400?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``waveshare_ble400`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:waveshare_ble400]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = waveshare_ble400

You can override default Waveshare BLE400 settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `waveshare_ble400.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-nordicnrf51/blob/master/boards/waveshare_ble400.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:waveshare_ble400]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = waveshare_ble400

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = nrf51822

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 32000000L


Uploading
---------
Waveshare BLE400 supports the next uploading protocols:

* ``blackmagic``
* ``jlink``
* ``nrfjprog``
* ``stlink``

Default protocol is ``jlink``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:waveshare_ble400]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = waveshare_ble400

  upload_protocol = jlink

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

Waveshare BLE400 does not have on-board debug probe and **IS NOT READY** for debugging. You will need to use/buy one of external probe listed below.
