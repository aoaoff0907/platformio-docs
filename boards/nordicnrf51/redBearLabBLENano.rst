Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_nordicnrf51`: The Nordic nRF51 Series is a family of highly flexible, multi-protocol, system-on-chip (SoC) devices for ultra-low power wireless applications. nRF51 Series devices support a range of protocol stacks including Bluetooth Smart (previously called Bluetooth low energy), ANT and proprietary 2.4GHz protocols such as Gazell.

    - NRF51822
  * - **Frequency**
    - 16MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 256KB

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``redBearLabBLENano`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:redBearLabBLENano]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = redBearLabBLENano

You can override default RedBearLab BLE Nano 1.5 settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `redBearLabBLENano.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-nordicnrf51/blob/master/boards/redBearLabBLENano.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:redBearLabBLENano]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = redBearLabBLENano

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = nrf51822

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 16000000L


Uploading
---------
RedBearLab BLE Nano 1.5 supports the next uploading protocols:

* ``blackmagic``
* ``cmsis-dap``
* ``jlink``
* ``mbed``
* ``nrfjprog``
* ``stlink``

Default protocol is ``cmsis-dap``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:redBearLabBLENano]
  platform = nordicnrf51
  board = redBearLabBLENano

  upload_protocol = cmsis-dap

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

RedBearLab BLE Nano 1.5 has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
