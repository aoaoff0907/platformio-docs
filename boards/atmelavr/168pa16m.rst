Microduino Core (Atmega168PA@16M,5V)
====================================

.. contents::

Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_atmelavr`: Atmel AVR 8-bit MCUs deliver a unique combination of performance, power efficiency and design flexibility. Optimized to speed time to market-and easily adapt to new ones-they are based on the industry's most code-efficient architecture for C and assembly programming

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - ATMEGA168P
  * - **Frequency**
    - 16MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 15.50KB
  * - **RAM**
    - 1KB
  * - **Vendor**
    - `Microduino <http://wiki.microduinoinc.com/Microduino-Module_Core?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``168pa16m`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:168pa16m]
  platform = atmelavr
  board = 168pa16m

You can override default Microduino Core (Atmega168PA@16M,5V) settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `168pa16m.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelavr/blob/master/boards/168pa16m.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:168pa16m]
  platform = atmelavr
  board = 168pa16m

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = atmega168p

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 16000000L

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

Microduino Core (Atmega168PA@16M,5V) has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
