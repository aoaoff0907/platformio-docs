Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_nordicnrf52`: The nRF52 Series are built for speed to carry out increasingly complex tasks in the shortest possible time and return to sleep, conserving precious battery power. They have a Cortex-M4F processor and are the most capable Bluetooth Smart SoCs on the market.

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``sdt52832b`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt52832b]
  platform = nordicnrf52
  board = sdt52832b

You can override default SDT52832B settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `sdt52832b.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-nordicnrf52/blob/master/boards/sdt52832b.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt52832b]
  platform = nordicnrf52
  board = sdt52832b

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = nrf52832

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 64000000L


Uploading
---------
SDT52832B supports the next uploading protocols:

* ``blackmagic``
* ``cmsis-dap``
* ``jlink``
* ``mbed``
* ``nrfjprog``
* ``stlink``

Default protocol is ``mbed``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:sdt52832b]
  platform = nordicnrf52
  board = sdt52832b

  upload_protocol = mbed

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

SDT52832B does not have on-board debug probe and **IS NOT READY** for debugging. You will need to use/buy one of external probe listed below.
