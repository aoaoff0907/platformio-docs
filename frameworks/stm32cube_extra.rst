Using with STM32CubeMX
----------------------

At the moment there is no seamless integration with projects generated by *STM32CubeMX*
tool. Instead, a small cross-platform Python application called ``stm32pio``
can be used to create and update PlatformIO projects from *STM32CubeMX* ``.ioc`` files.
It uses *STM32CubeMX* to generate a HAL-framework-based code and alongside creates
PlatformIO project with compatible parameters to stick them both together.

More details about ``stm32pio`` tool can be found in `the official repository <https://github.com/ussserrr/stm32pio>`_.
